			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenges us to organize our files inside of our repository and link files to each other using HTML.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problems we ran into was finding the css files for our homepage and figuring out what screenshots should be submitted to the assignment pdf. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put a moderate amount of energy into this assignment. It was a little more work than I was expecting but I still thought it was fairly simple due to most of our files already being set up via copying the repository from Installfest.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This screenshot is the results of our file organization:</p>
