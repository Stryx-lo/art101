			<h1>Lab 11 - Javascript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To learn how to use an input box and sort the input.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really run into many big problems in this lab. I had to do some fiddling with the code since it didn't work the first time and Hilary did too but it started working pretty quickly. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment was pretty simple. It's interesting when I recognize things that we learned earlier, like converting strings into and array to sort them. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Your sorted name:</p>
			</div>

            <div id="output">
                <h2>Name Sorting Machine:</h2>
                <input  type="text" id="user-name" placeholder="Input your name">
				<button id="submit">Sort!</button>
