			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Learning and experimenting with Javascript and variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had to do a little experimenting with the Java console since I didn't remember how to do the console log but I figured it out pretty quickly. I also didn't know what the "br" meant in Writeln but I found out it means line break. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this lab went well. I didn't have many problems and I'm starting to feel more solid in remembering html and css tags without having to look them up. I put an average amount of energy into this assignment, but I still made sure that I was understanding the new material in Javascript and also added some extra css styling. </p>
