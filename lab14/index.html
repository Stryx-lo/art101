			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To learn debugging strategies and debug previous labs if needed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>

					<h2>Results</h2>
