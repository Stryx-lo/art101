                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>To learn how to use APIs.</p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had some problems with figuring out how to make the template code from the assignment work with my
                    API. First, I needed to add a random number generator to get a random ID from the API endpoint.
                    Then, my code was only printing [Object, Object] so I had to tell it to print specific parts of the
                    object. I had to have ChatGPT help me with a lot of this, but I understand why my previous code
                    wasn't working now.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This lab was quite difficult, since it was complicated to get the template AJAX code to work with the API I chose. I still put in the effort to learn why it went wrong, even if I used ChatGPT to help debug my code.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Click the button below for a random pokemon:</p>
            </div>
