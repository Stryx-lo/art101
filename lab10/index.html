			<h1>Lab 10 - Javascript for the Web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To learn how to make random text that a button can output</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really run into any problems in this lab. For some reason my published website has different css than my local one, but it's not really creating a big problem.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment went pretty good. I didn't really have many issues and I got to do a little extra with figuring out where the sample code from the assignment page went in the js file. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My output below here and your randomized fruit list:</p>
			</div>

            <div id="output">
                <h2>Script Output</h2>
				<p>Random fruit smoothie ingredients:</p>
				<button id="button-output">Get Ingredients</button>
