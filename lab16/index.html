			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To use an API and JSON to print out information on to our website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The xkcd API that we were supposed to use for this assignment required an API key that we couldn't get so I had to switch to a different API for this assignment. Once I switched to something different, then my code worked.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment wasn't too difficult, but it was a bit frustrating that the API that we were meant to work with was broken. It was a bit of a search to find an API that was equally simple, but using the code we did in class on Tuesday I was able to complete the assignment without many issues.</p>
