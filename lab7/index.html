			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To learn how to make a function and sort a string.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really run into any problems in this lab. I had an extra parenthesis at some point that threw out an error but it was quickly solved.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this assignment went well. The instructions were very clear which made the lab somewhat simple. I didn't put much extra into this assignment since I've been pretty busy recently. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My script below here and your sorted name:</p>
