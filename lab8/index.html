			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions</h1>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Learn how to use anon functions in javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We ran into a lot of trouble with this assignment. We got stuck due to slightly unclear instructions in the first part of using the console, then got unfixably stuck at the end of the console. We never figured out how to get our anonymous function to print with console.log. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was pretty difficult. The code explanantions on the assignment page didn't feel very clear so we kept running into trouble even when copy-pasting the code from the assignment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Seen on turned-in pdf.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
